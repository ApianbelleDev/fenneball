# CONTROLS:
controls are controller only for 1 player mode unfortunately. I will probably add keyboard controls if people really want them.

**menu**:<br>
dpad up/down - cycle through menu options<br>
dpad (xbox)A/(ps)cross/(nintendo)B - select menu option

**1 Player Mode**:<br>
dpad up   - move paddle up<br>
dpad down - move paddle down

**2 Player Mode**<br>
dpad up        - p1 paddle up<br>
dpad down      - p1 paddle down<br>
up arrow key   - p2 paddle up<br>
down arrow key - p2 paddle down


# BUILDING FROM SOURCE:
if you would like to build this from source, ~~I.E, if you want to make changes~~, it's pretty simple. you just need to have raylib installed, set raylib's path in the makefile (line 36), and make installed. then just type `make`, and if configured correctly, should build the project.
